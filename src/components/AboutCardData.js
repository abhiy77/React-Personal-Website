    header: 'The Evolution of C++ as a Programming Language',
    paragraphOne: `C++ is a very useful programming language. Many educational curriculums will include either C or C++ as the tool entry-level programmers
    will use to learn the syntax, semantics, and data structures key to effective programming that is required of computer scientists.
    C++ is such a diverse language, one cannot help but wonder how it became the popular language it is today, and this paper is going to
    demonstrate just that.`,
    paragraphTwo: ` C is the great-grandfather of C++, designed in 1963. It is short for “Combined Programming Language.”  Many features within CPL are from, or are largely based on, 
    Algol 60, which was a programming language developed in the early 1960’s. It was…show more content…
    CPL uses standard operators and conditional statements, as well as loops called cycles, and is capable of evaluating expressions in both “right-hand” 
    and “left-hand” modes, meaning it evaluates one side of an expression first before the other. CPL also supports the use of a “compound command,” using a special symbol §.`

    paragraphOne: `Technology is a word with a wide concept. It could not be explained in few words. It has been helping us in making our life a more convenient
    one. Day by day we are being introduced to newer technologies thereby replacing the older ones. It is the modern era and the people are
    tech-savvy. Technology has become an important part of everyone’s life and thus has reduced the complexities. It is very difficult to imagine
    our life without these technological tools.`,
    paragraphTwo: `Technology has totally changed the way of teaching and learning. The blackboard, chalk, and dusters have been replaced by the smart board and smart classes. The invention of computers has brought a revolutionary change in our life. Today there are different models and advanced forms of computers available in the market like laptops, ipads, notebooks, smart phones, etc. Teaching has become easier as the videos and images related to different topics can be shown to the students along with teaching. This makes it easy for the students to understand the relevant topic. Teacher’s nowadays can easily communicate with the parents and keep them updated by their child’s performance.

    \n In colleges, students are asked to bring laptops, especially in professional courses. It is easier to carry a laptop instead of a heap of notebooks. Many universities have started the online examination for students. The earlier pen and paper-based competitive exams have been replaced by the online mode of examination. Thus it can be stated that these all things are possible because of the advancing technological tools. Nothing could be made easier without the emerging technologies.`
